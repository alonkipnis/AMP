# Approximate Message Passing and Related Topics

Approximate message passing (AMP) techniques for simplifying inference problems and proving optimality of inference procedures have attracted great interest in recent years. These techniques are based on a fast, iterative, procedure inspired by loopy belief propagation in graphical models; they can simplify a complicated inference problem into a sequence of computationally tractable "local" problems. Moreover, the per-iteration behavior in AMP can be rigorously characterized by a simple state-evolution procedure that leads, under some conditions, to Bayes optimal solutions. Therefore, in addition for being an efficient inference technique, AMP is also used in proving optimality of inference methods. 


The goal of this seminar series is to cover recent variants of AMP-based techniques, as well as recent successes in using the state-evolution property of AMP techniques for proving optimality of inference procedures.
