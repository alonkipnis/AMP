# Approximate Message Passing and Related Topics

In recent years there have been a great interest in asymptotic message passing (AMP) techniques for simplifying complicated inference problem into a sequence seqeunce of computationally tracktable "local" problems. In addition for being an inference technique, the per-iteration behavior of the AMP algorithm can be reigorously chracterized by a simple state-evolution procedure that leads, under some conditions, to Bayes opitmal solutions. 
#AMP methods are based on Gaussian approximations to loopy belief propogation in graphical models. 

In this seminar series, presenters discuss recent generalizations of AMP and recent successes in using it for proving optimality of inference procedures.
